# Appendix: Guide to Data Visualization

Throughout these labs, we have created numerous high quality data visualizations using the class data sets. While you can always use the code we have created there - which may even help refresh your memory on the data analysis skills you've learned - this guide is designed to be a quick, additional resource for the creation and customization of data visualizations using the Tidyverse and `ggplot2`. 

__Note:__ While this quick guide is hopefully helpful, it is by no means complete. Remember that R and the Tidyverse are open source; you can always find help online, such as this [Data Visualization Cheat Sheet](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-cheatsheets/data-visualization-2-1-cheat-sheet) from RStudio.

## Deciding Which Visualization to Use

Remember - the type of data you are using _matters_. 

## Adding Labels

## Scale and Limits

## Confidence Intervals

## Adding Color

## Creating a Legend

## Using Themes
